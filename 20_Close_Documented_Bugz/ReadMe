This script can be used to close the bugs in "Resolved" status for which product release is announced, i.e
 bugs which are already documented by the Documentation team

Script file: check_and_close_bugz_status.py

Usage: python3 check_and_close_bugz_status.py <bugz_id_to_close>    OR
       ./check_and_close_bugz_status.py <bugz_id_to_close>

Requirement:
- As per the process, the bugs can be closed for which documentation is already done i.e. 'SecDocDone' whiteboard
- These documented bugs only will be part of product release announcement and will be visible to customers
- Once this processes are done, bugz can be closed
- Thus, to sum up the requirement: The current status of the bug should be 'Resolved' and it should have been documented.

Notes:
- This script uses your mvista bugz id & password to work and will update the bugz site with your id only.
- Once you provide proper input to the script, execution starts and it will ask for bugz id & password.
- If you want to update multiple bugs, you can hardcode your 'bugz-id' & 'password' in the script. Check script code to identify the location.

Type of inputs:
- You can run the script for single a bug at a time.
- To update multiple bugs at a time (you would want to hardcode your id & pass in this case), check following options

1) Update single bug:

	$ ./check_and_close_bugz_status.py <bugz_id>

2) Update more than one bug:
- This is open ended choice but following steps can be used:

	$ list="bugid1 bugid2 bugid3"
	$ echo $list							## confirm the input i.e. bug ids are correct
	$ for i in $list; do ./check_and_close_bugz_status.py $i; done

3) If you have csv list of bugs from bugzilla site:
- This is open ended choice but following steps can be used:

	Edit the csv file with GUI editor tool like 'LibreOffice Calc', remove columns other than bugz id and save the file.
	Edit the same file with terminal editor tool like 'vim', remove any unnecessary data like blank spaces/extra lines and save the file.

	$ list=`cat <csv_file_name>`
	$ echo $list							## confirm the input i.e. bug ids are correct
	$ for i in $list; do ./check_and_close_bugz_status.py $i; done
